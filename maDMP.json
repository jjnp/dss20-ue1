It is based on a fully labelled dataset consisting of alittle over 5000 text messages from various sources. The data is transformed such that it is more suitable for machine learning approaches, and then used to create a sequential neural network model using Keras with a Tensorflow backend. After training the final accuracy score and loss value are presented, alongside graphs that show their change over the course of model fitting.",
